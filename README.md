In this project, I explored the potential of machine learning to predict customer attrition (churn) for credit card companies. Using publicly available data on customer demographics and credit card activity, I analyzed key factors that influence churn behavior, such as average transaction amount and credit limit. These insights were then used to build machine learning models to predict customers at risk of closing their accounts.

Despite limitations in the dataset, including the absence of card type and issuing institution details, the project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can enhance customer retention strategies in the financial services industry. Future work will focus on incorporating more granular data and addressing ethical considerations around data privacy and responsible marketing to ensure the successful deployment of these models.
